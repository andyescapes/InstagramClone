(optional) TODO!

Bonus Features:

- More in depth Live Updates
    - Post likes and comments are updated live as expected. However, the list of comments and list of users who like the post are also updated live. Cases that produce no results, eg liking an already liked post, commenting empty comments, etc have all been accounted for
    - Deleting user's posts are also reflected live
    - Notifications are closed live.

- Follower Recommender
    - Generates random recommendations of users to follow and a button that allows the user to follow immediately.
    - In addition a user can type in another user's username to follow them that way

- UI/UX Improvements beyond assignment brief
    - edit details are hidden and can be revealed when the button is pressed
    - the list of comments is hidden and revealed by clicking on the label as is the list of likers. User's can click the following label to reveal users they follow and then unfollow from there.
    - notifications appear on the top of feed only when they are received to not clutter space
    - Overall despite small changes the brief did not require any of this and took a fair amount of additional time.
