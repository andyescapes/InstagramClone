Accessibility and Usability Summary

- Overall intuitive user interfaace and experience. Only three main "pages" being the login page, the feed and the user profile view, making the UX easy to follow. The feed adhere's to modern day image sharing appplication practices and posting and liking comments are clear. The my profile page clearly shows profile details and posts follow in the same consistent style that is present on the feed. Also links are relatively bold on pages and on hovering the change in opacity and underline conveys that the links are clickable. 

- Through the use of clickable links hiding information that can be long eg. all the comments I have greatly reduced the clutter of my web application so important functions can be easily seen and not missed.

- The monochrome colour palette features contrasting text throughout the web application. ie. black on white and black on light grey. In addition the lack of coloured components will allow colour blind individuals to navigate throught the app seamlessly.

- Images all contain alt text being a photo posted by the user which is included in the alt text.

- Input fields have labels to help users identify what the text input is used for.

- Headers are largely used in a sequential order sttarting from h1 as the quickpic logo to h2 for more prominent headings and then h3 for other details.

- The site is also usable anywhere fromm mobile to tablet to ultra wide views.
